## Vector

Vector is a class to describe a two or three dimensional Euclidian (geometric) vector. The datatype stores the
components of the vector (x and y for 2D, and x, y and z for 3D).

Since vectors represent groupings of values, we cannot use simple addition, multiplication, etc. Instead, some adapted vector math is required, which is made easy by the methods inside the Vector class.
